Great question! Let me clarify what the credit score represents and how it's computed:

## **🎯 What the Credit Score Represents:**

**YES, Higher Score = Higher Risk**

- **0-25 (Very Low)** 🟢 = Low geopolitical risk → Better creditworthiness
- **25-50 (Low)** 🔵 = Moderate geopolitical risk
- **50-75 (Moderate)** 🟡 = Elevated geopolitical risk
- **75-90 (High)** 🟠 = High geopolitical risk → Worse creditworthiness  
- **90-100 (Extreme)** 🔴 = Very high geopolitical risk → Poor creditworthiness

## **⚙️ How the Credit Score is Computed:**

The score combines **two key components**:

### **1. Level Percentile (Current Risk Level)**
- Takes the current GPR value and compares it to historical values
- If GPR is at the 80th percentile historically → contributes 80 points to the score
- Higher GPR levels = higher percentile = higher score

### **2. Change Percentile (Risk Momentum)**  
- Measures how much GPR has changed recently (e.g., over 6 months)
- Compares recent changes to historical changes in a rolling window
- If GPR increased more than 90% of historical changes → contributes 90 points
- Rapid increases in GPR = higher score

### **3. Final Score Calculation:**
```
Raw Score = (Level Weight × Level_Percentile) + (Change Weight × Change_Percentile)

Where:
- Level Weight = 0.7 (default, adjustable)
- Change Weight = 0.3 (1 - Level Weight)
```

### **4. Smoothing & Events:**
- **EWMA Smoothing**: Applies exponential smoothing to reduce noise
- **Event Overlay**: Adds temporary score boosts during significant geopolitical events
- **Final Range**: Clips score between 0-100

## **🔍 Example:**

**Country X in January 2024:**
- **Current GPR Level**: 45 (this is the 75th percentile historically)
- **6-Month Change**: +12 (this increase ranks at 85th percentile of recent changes)
- **Raw Score**: (0.7 × 75) + (0.3 × 85) = 52.5 + 25.5 = **78 points**
- **Interpretation**: **High Risk** 🟠 - significant geopolitical tensions affecting creditworthiness

## **💡 Key Insights:**

1. **High GPR = High Credit Risk**: More geopolitical instability means higher borrowing costs and default risk

2. **Momentum Matters**: A country with rapidly worsening geopolitical situation gets penalized more

3. **Relative Scoring**: Scores are relative to each country's own history, not absolute levels

4. **Forward-Looking**: Recent changes help predict where risk is heading

This transforms raw geopolitical risk data into an intuitive 0-100 credit risk score that financial institutions can use for country risk assessment, sovereign bond pricing, and investment decisions.
